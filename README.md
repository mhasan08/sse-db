# SSE-DB

SSE-DB is based on the cryptographic concept of Searchable Symmteric Encryption. It is fully functional multithreaded relational database. This repository contains drivers for SSE-DB (for more info visit following <a href="http://www.sse-db.com/">link</a>). Currently, three languages are supported for connecting SSE-DB, Java, C# and C/CPP.

The Searchable Symmetric Encryption is a cryptographic concept to facilitate searching on encrypted data. Due to the constraint of the encryption and the unavailability of any practical homomorphic encryption sub routine, SSE-DB is unable to perform operations like the average, sum etc. The updates to the database is based on the keywords that follows a traditional SQL like wrapper.
